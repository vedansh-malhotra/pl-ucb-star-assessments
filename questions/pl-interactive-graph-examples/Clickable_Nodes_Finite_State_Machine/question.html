<p>
  Consider an FSM representing an automated library system with a specific operational flow. The system is designed to handle a unique sequence of tasks each day, involving book checkouts, returns, catalog updates, and member services. Each transition between states involves an action with an associated weight.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The day starts with processing book returns.</li>
  <li>After handling returns, the system updates the catalog.</li>
  <li>If there are new members, their registration is processed next; otherwise, the system moves directly to restocking returned books.</li>
  <li>After dealing with new members or restocking, the system addresses member queries.</li>
  <li>The day ends with event planning and closing tasks.</li>
  
<p>Note: In your answer, do not try to click on start or end, just the states in between are needed. The order does not matter, and there is no partial credit. </p>
</ol>
